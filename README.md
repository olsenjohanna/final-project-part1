# Final Project (part 1 - html, css and javacsript)

The assignment was to use an open API and to apply the things we have learned during the prior 8 weeks in the course. 

My final project is based on open API for "Sveriges Radio". My idea was to display the schedule for the channels P1, P2 and P3; both for today, tomorrow and for next day. It is also possible to listen what plays right now.
